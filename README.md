# Macro Counter Web Application

## How to set up environment
* Inside `/macro-counter`, create a virtual environment with the following command: `python3 -m venv venv`.
* Activate the virtual environment with `source venv/bin/activate`.
* If you have successfully activated the virtual environment, you should see a `"venv"` tag in your terminal. 
* Install required packages using `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* If you want to install any additional libraries, install them into the environment using `pip install <package-name>`. Save your dependencies into `requirements.txt` using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`.
